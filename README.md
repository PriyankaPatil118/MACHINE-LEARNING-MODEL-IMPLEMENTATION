DESCRIPTION:This project focuses on implementing a machine learning model using the scikit-learn library in Python. The goal is to build a predictive model that can classify or predict outcomes based on a given dataset, such as spam email detection. The project includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and performance visualization. The final deliverable is a Jupyter Notebook that clearly demonstrates the entire workflow of the modelâ€™s implementation and evaluation.
